###Notes:
1. You'll need to copy paste LSystem.mel, which is the GUI file, onto script editor under MEL command line, then execute all to generate the menu item. In LSystem.mel file, the number of instance need to be manually changed due to the increasing number of instances. By default all function use name instance1, (instance2), but when you already created instance1, it will display error saying instance1 is already connected with other parameters, in that case please kindly change the instance# in the GUI file manually. 

2.  In the grammar file input field, make sure you input grammar instead of path to make it work.
